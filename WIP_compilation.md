# Basilisk II Compilation

## On macOS

You need `cvs`, `autoconf` and `automake`. If you don't have them installed yet, then you can install them e.g. via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install cvs
brew install autoconf
brew install automake
```

Now you are ready to compile:

```sh
cd [path_to_Basilisk_II_folder]/src/Unix
./autogen.sh
make
```

Note that many warnings are generated which I am investigating.

I have tested Basilisk II 1.0 on macOS 10.14.3 and 10.13.6, emulating Mac OS 9.0.4 and running a standalone application generated by HyperCard 2.4.1.
