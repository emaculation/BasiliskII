# Pre-KeepAChangelog releases

## [v1.0.0] (V1.0 snapshot) – (date unknown)
### Added
- Unix: add large file support for 2+ GB hard disk images
- Unix: implemented `ignoresegv` feature on Linux/x86, Linux/ppc, Darwin/ppc
- Unix: new ether prefs option `tun` to use a TUN/TAP interface. The `configure` script used can be overriden with `etherconfig`
- Unix: sheep_net driver ported to kernel 2.6 (patches from Mac-On-Linux)
- Unix: add user-mode network emulation stack, enabled with `slirp`
- Unix: implement X11 to MacOS exchange of text through the clipboard
- Windows: a new port derived from Lauri's work is now available

### Changed
- backport `idlewait` feature from SheepShaver
- JIT: integrated dynamic translator for Linux/x86 and FreeBSD/x86
- JIT: ported backend to support Linux/x86\_64 (AMD64 and EM64T platforms)
- JIT: improve detection of newer CPUs based on the P4 core but fallback to a safe default, if necessary
- Unix: moved minimum `autoconf` support to 2.52+
- Unix: cleaned up `pthread` attributes [Brian Johnson]
- Unix: it is now possible to make the serial drivers pipe their input/output to programs by using a '|' followed by a command line as the modem or printer port setting (instead of a device name like `/dev/ttyS0`) [Brian Johnson]
- Unix: the option `--config FILE` tells B2 to use a different config file
- Unix: new prefs options `dsp` and `mixer` to set the OSS device names instead of the hardcoded `/dev/dsp` and `/dev/mixer`
- Unix: SDL audio and video output are now available in option
- Unix: improve overall responsiveness on NetBSD platforms

### Fixed
- fixed support for volumes larger than 4 GB
- fixed the problem with Ticks getting incremented on every interrupt, not just 60 Hz (e.g. moving the mouse made the caret blink faster)
- JIT: fixed translation through constant jumps (`jitinline` config option)
- Unix: fixed floppy problems under Linux
- Unix: serial port baud rates are now set correctly
- Unix: fix network code to work correctly on 64-bit platforms
- Unix: fix GUI to build with newer GTK+2

## V1.0 snapshot) - 2002-01-15
### Added
- added support for on-the-fly video resolution and depth switching, and gamma tables
- added support for platform-independant mutexes, used by adb.cpp for thread-safe mouse handling

### Changed
- fsave/frestore emulation under AmigaOS and NetBSD/m68k always behaves like a 68882/68040 FPU, eliminating the need for 68060 FPU patches
- the TIME_OFFSET constant has been replaced by a (portable) function TimeToMacTime(); file dates in ExtFS should now be correct
- ADBInterrupt() is no longer called from the 60 Hz interrupt but has its own interrupt flag, potentially increasing the smoothness of mouse movement
- ether.cpp: implemented relatively platform-independant "AppleTalk over UDP" mode that doesn't require any special kernel modules or network drivers but can only interconnect instances of Basilisk II; this is enabled by setting `udptunnel` to `true`
- Unix: windowed display mode supports different resolutions and color depths, which can be switched on-the-fly
- Unix: `Ctrl-F5` grabs mouse in windowed mode (enhanced compatibility with games like flight simulators)
- Unix: X11 events are handled as soon as they arrive, outside of the 60 Hz video refresh raster
- Unix: audio sample rate, bit depth and channel count are adjustable in the MacOS `Sound` control panel

- BeOS `serial_beos.cpp`: `serdtDCE` is set in `PrimeIn()/PrimeOut()`
- Unix `serial_unix.cpp`: `serdtDCE` is set in `PrimeIn()/PrimeOut()`
- Unix `video_x.cpp`: pressing `F12` and q will quit Basilisk II in DGA mode (useful when it crashed)

### Removed
- `main_*.cpp`: disabled UAE FPU (as it is buggy)
- `rom_patches.cpp`: removed unnecessary `a0/a1` save/restore from drivers
- `slot_rom.cpp`: removed unnecessary `a0/a1` save/restore from drivers

### Fixed
- AmigaOS: the Kickstart ROM is no longer used to redirect NIL pointer accesses as this crashes some machines (especially 68040-based); a scratch memory block is used instead
- AmigaOS `main_amiga.cpp`: when the memory for the Mac RAM and ROM cannot be allocated, an error message is displayed (instead of crashing)

## V0.3 (alpha) - 1999-03-14
### Added
- Unix `video_x.cpp`: added 15, 16 and 32-bit window modes [Bill Huey]
- added documentation of preferences file format to README

### Fixed
- BeOS `video_beos.cpp`: `screen` prefs item is now either `win/<width>/<height>` for window mode or `scr` for full-screen mode

## V0.2 (alpha) - 1999-03-11
### Added
- `uae\memory.cpp`: added support for frame buffer pixel type conversion in virtual addressing mode, the Mac frame buffer layout now has to be specified in `MacFrameLayout` (`video.h`)

### Changed
- tested with ROM versions 19 and 26
- `prefs.cpp`: renamed `TYPE_BOOL` to `TYPE_BOOLEAN` beacuse of name clash on BeOS R4.1
- Unix `video_x.cpp`: the `screen` prefs item is now read to select window mode (with a specified window size) or DGA mode
- Unix `video_x.cpp`: DGA mode supports 15, 16 and 32-bit modes (packed 24-bit pixels don't work)
- Unix `Makefile.linux`: added `-D_REENTRANT` to compiler flags

## V0.2 (alpha) - 1999-01-23
### Added
- first alpha release
